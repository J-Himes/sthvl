1) Where is the cross encoder initialized?
2) Where in the code can you find the structure of the visual transformer?
3) Where is the loss function (any loss function)?
4) Where is the data initialized?
5) Where are the train epoch and eval epoch located, and what are they doing
   on a high level
6) Where is text processing/masking taking place? What is it doing exactly?
7) Get familiar with dataloaders.
8) What do batches consist of?
9) How are the encoders/decoders configured? (e.g. how do I change vocab size
   in text transformer?)
10) What generates the output used for evaluation?
11) What pre-training is done?
12) What's the primary downstream task being done? How many downstream tasks
    can UniVL do?
